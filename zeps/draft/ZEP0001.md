## Abstract

This ZEP proposes a new major version of the core specification which
defines how to store and retrieve Zarr data. The ZEP also proposes a
new framework for modularising specifications of codecs, storage
systems and extensions.


## Motivation and Scope

The Zarr specification version 2 [[ZARR2SPEC](#ref-ZARR2SPEC)]
(hereafter "Zarr v2") has been widely adopted and implemented in
several programming languages. It has enabled the use of cloud and
distributed computing to process a variety of large and challenging
datasets, particularly in the scientific domain. It has also provided
a vehicle for experimentation and innovation in the field of data
storage for high-performance distributed computing.

As usage of Zarr has grown and broadened, several limitations of Zarr
v2 have surfaced. These include:

* **Interoperability**. Zarr v2 has been implemented in Python, C, C++,
  Julia, Java and JavaScript. However, there is not feature parity
  across all implementations. Implementations are also not currently
  available for some important languages, such as R. This is in part
  because the Zarr v2 spec was originally developed together with the
  Python implementation, which itself leans heavily on the use of
  NumPy concepts and machinery. A more language-agnostic approach to
  the core specification, together with some slimming down of the
  specification, would help to achieve complete implementations with
  full interoperobility across major programming languages.

* **Extensibility**. Zarr is increasingly being used for storage of
  very large and keystone scientific datasets. If this trend
  continues, interoperability and stability of the Zarr ecosystem will
  be vital, to allow these datasets to be utilised to their full
  potential. At the same time, large-scale array data storage is a
  very active area of innovation, and there remain many opportunities
  to improve performance, scalability and resilience for I/O-bound
  high-performance distributed computing. To balance these demands for
  stability and innovation, some framework for community exploration
  and development of Zarr extensions is needed, so that innovation can
  happen in a coordinated way with predictable consequences and
  behaviour of implementations which may not support all extensions.

* **High-latency storage**. Zarr v2 was originally developed to support
  local file system storage. Because of this, the design of Zarr v2
  implicitly made assumptions about the performance characteristics of
  the underlying storage technology, such as low latency for storage
  operations to list directories and check existence of
  files. Fortunately, certain features of Zarr v2 still enabled other
  storage systems to be used, such as cloud object stores, and this
  ability to utilise a variety of different underlying storage systems
  has been very valuable across a range of use cases. However,
  performance of certain operations can degrade significantly with
  some storage technologies, particularly systems with relatively high
  latency per operation, such as cloud object stores. This limitation
  has been worked around through the use of consolidated metadata, but
  this workaround introduces other limitations, such as additional
  complexity when adding or modifying data.

* **Storage layout flexibility**. Zarr v2 adopts a simple storage model
  where each chunk is encoded and then written to a single storage
  object. This simplicity makes implementation easier, but presents
  some practical challenges. For example, for large datasets this can
  generate a very large number of storage objects, which does not work
  well for certain storage technologies. Also, this forces one
  retrieval operation per chunk, which can be suboptimal where there
  are many chunks that are often read together, and/or where different
  access patterns need to be accommodated.

These limitations have motivated the proposal described here to define
a new major version of the Zarr core specification, together with a
new modular specification framework.

Normally, it is better to introduce changes in small pieces, allowing
each to be evaluated and discussed in isolation. However, addressing
the limitations described above could not be done without introducing
backwards-incompatible changes into the core specification, and thus
multiple such changes are combined here, in an attempt to minimise the
overall disruption to the ecosystem and the community.


## Usage and Impact

This ZEP and the associated specifications have the following intended
outcomes:

1. Facilitate implementation of a core specification with feature
   parity and full interoperability across all major programming
   languages.

2. Accelerate innovation by facilitating the exploration, development,
   implementation and evaluation of Zarr systems with support for
   novel encoding technologies, storage technologies and features by a
   broader community.

3. Ensure reasonable performance characteristics of all Zarr
   implementations across a variety of different underlying storage
   technologies, including storage with high latency per operation.

4. Improve the performance characteristics of Zarr implementations for
   data with a very large number of chunks and/or with a variety of
   common access patterns.

Adopting this ZEP would have the following disruptive impacts on the
members of the Zarr community:

* Effort and coordination would be required to implement the
  specifications in all current Zarr software libraries and verify
  interoperability.

* Effort would be required by data producers to migrate to generating
  data conformant with the new specifications.

* Some effort may be required by users of Zarr data and/or Zarr
  software libraries to learn about and understand the differences in
  available features and/or how certain features are accessed.


## Backward Compatibility

This ZEP introduces a Zarr core specification version 3, which is
backwards-incompatible with the Zarr version 2 specification
[[ZARR2SPEC](#ref-ZARR2SPEC)].

Implementations of the Zarr version 3 core specification are not
required to be able to read or write data conforming to the Zarr
version 2 specification, and vice versa.


## Detailed description

Below is a summary of some of the key features of the proposed new
specification and specification framework. Please see the
specification drafts for further information, linked below in the
specifications section.


### Modularity

This ZEP proposes a modular specification framework, with the following components:

* **[Zarr core
  specification](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core/v3.0.html)**
  -- This specification is the starting point for any Zarr
  implementation. It defines in an abstract way a format for storing
  N-dimensional array data.

* **Zarr extension specifications** -- This is an open-ended set of
  specifications which add new features to and/or modify the Zarr
  format in some way. There is a further breakdown of different
  extension types, described in more detail below.

* **Zarr codec specifications** -- This is an open-ended set of
  specifications, each of which defines a protocol for encoding and
  decoding Zarr chunk data.

* **Zarr store specifications** -- This is an open-ended set of
  specifications, each of which defines a mapping from the abstract
  store API defined in the Zarr core specification to a set of
  concrete operations for a specific storage technology, such as a
  POSIX file system or cloud object storage.

The primary goal of this modularity is to allow specifications of new
extensions, codecs and stores to be added over time, without needing
any change to the core specification.

Note that the core specification allows for decentralised publishing
of extension, codec and store specifications. In other words, any
individual or organisation may publish such a specification. It is
hoped that the majority of such specifications will be published on
the zarr-specs website after a review process by the Zarr community,
thus providing a common point of discovery and coordination across the
community. However, we do not want to obstruct individuals or
organisation who need to innovate or experiment or who have
specialised needs which are better served by managing and publishing
specifications in a different way.

Note that we also anticipate that user groups from different domains
may wish to publish **usage convention specifications**, by which we
mean specifications that define conventions for the use of Zarr for a
particular type of data, such as restrictions and expectations
regarding the groups, arrays and attributes that will be found within
a Zarr dataset. How these usage convention specifications will be
managed, published and used is out of scope for this ZEP.

A draft of the Zarr version 3 core specification is available at the
following URL:

   * https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core/v3.0.html

Note publication of the draft specification on the zarr-specs website
preceded establishiment of the ZEP process, and does not imply
acceptance of this ZEP. The specification should be considered a
proposal at this time, pending acceptance of this ZEP.

To illustrate the principle of the other specification types, the
following specifications have also been published on the zarr-specs
website:

* [Codecs](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/codecs.html)

* Stores - [File system
  store](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stores/filesystem/v1.0.html)

* Array extensions -
  [Filters](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions/array-extensions/filters/v1.0.html)

* Data types - [Datetime data
  types](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions/data-types/datetime/v1.0.html)

* Storage transformers - [Sharding storage
  transformer](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions/storage-transformers/sharding/v1.0.html)

Note that some of these specifications are not complete at this
time. We leave it open at this time whether the scope of this ZEP
should be expanded to fully cover all of these specifications, or
whether further ZEPs should be created to cover these other specs.


### Extensibility

This ZEP proposes a number of mechanisms by which the Zarr core
protocol can be extended.

In general, there are two different kinds of extensions.

An extension may add new features to Zarr, in a way that does not
invalidate or break any processing of Zarr data to which the extension
applies by systems which do not implement the extension. In other
words, the use of the extension may be safely ignored by systems which
implement only the core specification.

Alternatively, an extension may modify or override the Zarr core
specification in some way, such that certain processing operations
must be aware of and implement the extension, otherwise data will
become corrupted or Zarr implementations will encounter unexpected
errors. In other words, the use of such an extension must not be
ignored by systems which implement only the core specification.

If a Zarr system does not implement a given extension, the Zarr core
specification describes the situations under which the extension can
be ignored and processing can proceed, and conversely where the
extension cannot be ignored and processing must terminate.

A further grouping of different kinds of extension is defined:

* **Generic extensions** -- These are extensions which apply to the
  processing of any data within a Zarr hierarchy.

* **Array extensions** -- These are extensions which apply to
  processing of an array within a Zarr hierarchy.

* **Data type extensions** -- These are extensions which define a new
  data type for array items, where the data type is not included in
  the set of core data types.

* **Chunk grid extensions** -- These are extensions which define a new
  way of dividing array items into chunks.

* **Chunk memory layout extensions** -- These are extensions which
  define a new way of organising the data from an array chunk into a
  contiguous sequence of bytes.

* **Storage transformer extensions** -- These are extensions which
  define a new storage transformation.

For each of these kinds of extensions, the core specification defines
a mechanism by which the extension is declared in the metadata
associated with a Zarr hierarchy or array, such that its use can be
discovered by a Zarr implementation, without requiring any out-of-band
communication. In other words, a system or user reading Zarr data
should not need to "know" anything about the extensions that were used
when the data were created, the data are fully self-describing.


### Scope reduction

In order to facilitate implementation of the core specification across
different programming languages, the scope of the specification has
been reduced relative to Zarr v2. Note in particular the following:

* The set of core data types is reduced relative to Zarr v2. Only
  fixed size integer and floating point data types are defined, in
  addition to a Boolean data type and a fixed length raw data
  type. Any data types relating to storage of textual data have been
  left for definition within an extension specification. The "object"
  data type, which was never included within the Zarr v2 spec but
  which was implemented in the Python implementation, is also not
  included -- it is suggested that a better approach be found for
  supporting variable length data types, and defined within a data
  type extension specification.

* Support for filters has been removed from the core specification. It
  is proposed this be covered in an extension specification.


### Accommodating high-latency storage

With Zarr v2, certain operations that require access to metadata can
be pathologically slow when running against data stored in a
high-latency storage system such as a cloud object store. These
include navigating the structure of a Zarr hierarchy, such as
obtaining a list of the child nodes of any given node, or generating a
textual representation of an entire hierarchy (e.g., as generated by
the `tree()` function in the Zarr Python implementation). These
operations are often required because it is a common use case for user
to be interactively exploring the content of a Zarr hierarchy with
which they are unfamiliar, and so poor performance seriously affects
usability.

A workaround for this with Zarr v2 has been the addition of
consolidated metadata. This involves packaging all metadata for a
hierarchy into a single storage object, which can then be read
once. This is a workable solution in many situations, where data are
written once and then read many times. However, it introduces some
additional complexity for data managers, who need to ensure that
consolidated metadata is generated, and then kept in sync with group
and array metadata if there are any subsequent changes.

The Zarr version 3 core specification redesigns the organisation of
data and metadata objects within a Zarr store, in order to better
accommodate high latency stores. While this does not completely remove
the need for consolidated metadata in all current situations where
that is used, it does vastly improve the performance of simple
operations to explore the structure and content of a Zarr hierarchy.

The new design leverages the fact that, although listing of objects in
cloud object stores is still much slower than listing of files in a
local file system, all major cloud stores support the ability to list
objects with a given prefix, which can be used to reduce the size of
the result set and usually returns much faster than listing an entire
bucket. It also provides an opportunity to better leverage the support
for emulating a directory listing, via providing both a "prefix" and a
"delimiter" parameter.

The new design separates the metadata and chunk data storage objects
via a different key prefix. All metadata objects have the key prefix
"/meta" and all chunk data objects have the key prefix "/data". This
allows a faster listing of all metadata keys within a given store. The
list of metadata keys is then sufficient to provide some useful
information to a user regarding the contents and structure of a Zarr
hierarchy.

The new design also changes the key suffix for metadata objects. For
example, for an array with hierarchy path "/foo/bar", the key for the
corresponding metadata object in Zarr v2 would be
"/foo/bar/.zarray". In Zarr v3 this becomes
"/meta/root/foo/bar.array.json". This change means that all the names
and types (array or group) of children of the "/foo" group can be
discovered and listed via a single storage operation to list the
objects with prefix "/meta/root/foo" and delimiter "/".
